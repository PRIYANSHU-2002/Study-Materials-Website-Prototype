# Study Materials Website
This is a basic project built using HTML and CSS by our group in the 3rd semester of our course. The site aims to provide study materials to first year engineering students of Computer Science. The site offers a plethora of learning materials in digital format such as e-books, video lectures, previous year question papers and class notes. The site is a result of collaborative diligence of all the team members whose names (including me) are mentioned below.
